    "Another rather popular built-in dataset is the Iris dataset. You will need to load it before continuing. The Iris dataset contains information about 3 types of the iris plant. The dataset contains 150 data tuples and their corresponding target labels.  Each tuple consists of four attributes about a certain plant: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width (all in cm units), in that order. The target label is integer 0, 1, or 2, representing the tuple's classification as an Iris Setosa, an Iris Versicolor, or an Iris Virginica, respectively.\n",
